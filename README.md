**Hades Description**
Hades is a flight computer I created for my current and future flight computers. This flight computer will be capable of dual parachute deployment, optimal attitude and position determination, and data logging. I currently test this flight computer at home and will conduct a flight test in my HPR Lotus before pursuing my Level 2 NAR certification.

**Specs:**
- Teensy 4.1
    -  https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html
- BMP 180
    - Pressure Sensor
    - Temperature Sensor
- NEO-6M GPS Module
- MPU 9250
    - 3 Axis Accelerometer
    - 3 Axis Gyroscope
    - 3 Axis Magnetometerer
    - Temperature Sensor
- Zeee 4S Lipo Battery
    - 14.8V 120C 2200mAh
- Multi-Colored LED
- Passive Buzzer
- Buck Converter
- MOSFETS



**Iterations:**
Iterations for the flight computer are due to trying out new things with the flight computer. Sometimes I also like to create a new version when stuck on problems to take a new and different approach to solving some of the problems I face while writing the code.
- Test - Individual Component Functionality Test
- V1 - Sensor Data Reading
- V2 - State Separation
